# Support Agent Chatbot for Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)

## Objective
The Support Agent Chatbot is designed to answer "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot retrieves relevant information from the official documentation of these CDPs to guide users on performing tasks or achieving specific outcomes within each platform.

## Core Functionalities
### 1. Answer "How-to" Questions
- Understands and responds to user queries related to performing specific tasks or using features within each CDP.
- Example questions:
  - "How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
  - "How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"
  - "How do I build an audience segment in Lytics?"
  - "How can I integrate my data with Zeotap?"

### 2. Extract Information from Documentation
- Navigates through official documentation.
- Identifies and extracts relevant sections to provide accurate responses.

### 3. Handle Variations in Questions
- Handles different question lengths and phrasings without breaking the response.
- Filters out irrelevant questions (e.g., "Which movie is getting released this week?").
